# Modern Portfolio Theory in R

This is a demo of Modern Portfolio Theory in R. The idea is that, when there are two or more risky assets, there exists an optimal portfolio of the assets for any given risk that maximizes the expected return. As long as there isn't perfect correlation between the assets, then the so-called unsystematic risk associated with a singular asset can be diversified away so that only the market, systematic risk remains.
